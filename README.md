### About

This is my fork of the [LOOT masterlist for Fallout New Vegas](https://github.com/loot/falloutnv). Instead of contributing directly to the masterlist, I will commit here, then pull request to the master there.

### Bash Tags Reference

Wrye Flash recognises the following Bash Tags specifically for Fallout: New Vegas:

* `Deflst`: Mod over-rides FormID changes, works a little like the `Delev` tag. Required for mods that remove items from repair lists, amongst other things.
* `Destructible`: Mod modifies destructible statistics for objects (Import Destuctible)
* `WeaponMods`: mod changes modifications for weapons (such as scope, suppressor, ex-magazine, etc.) (Import Weapon Modifications).
